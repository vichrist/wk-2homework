      <p>If there was anything that sparked my interest about my choice of majoring in Economics, it was the data! Yes, I myself am a data junkie and I'm fascinated with data analysis. From the idea of compiling information to making an inference of some probability distribution is by itself both phenominal and rewarding. I was planning to further my education for an M.A. in Economics, but after graduation I endulged on taking some time off for some self-care and ended up embarking on an unexpected endeavor. Although I enjoyed both the statistical and theoretical intricacies of economics, I wasn't settled by admitting that it was a passion. What I wanted was not only a challenge, but something that would spark my interest of excitement and creativity. 
      </p>
      <p>Now, as a student web developer, I'll admit that I have experienced the challenge, excitement and creativity. I'm ecstatic and eager to master what I have learned and all that is to come. Taking an active approach to learn something new has always been a part of who I am, but this time it's really differet-- I can at the least admit confidently that I have found a passion that I am looking forward to. 
      </p>

      <p>Not only do I enjoy educating myself, but I absolutely love to spend time with family. I am also a first time pet owner and have fallen head over heels for my pup. If there is anything more that I cherish in this life, it is the time we are given. When it comes down to it, all we have is time along with choices--may as well be wise with both". </p>
