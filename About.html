      <strong><h1>~~About~~</h1></strong>
      <p style="color: black; font-size: 20px; text-align: center;">WhippleWood CPAs| Firm Coordinator </p>
      <p style="color: black; font-size: 20px; text-align: center;">University of Denver| Student Web Developer <br><small><b>Client/Server Software Programming</small></b></p>

      <p style="font-size: 15px;">The potential of personal and professional growth is a privilege of opportunity, and opportunity is what allows us to discover both our interests and passions. Moreso frequently I find that educating myself has become quite ordinary, the idea of learning and exerting that knowledge to serve as a resource of any sort is a reward of its own. <br>
      </p>

      <p style="font-size: 15px;">While I have embarked on a few different journeys and have accomplished those endeavors, I admit that I have not continued to seek out those interests, rather I have taken on a new journey and have finally recognized that my interests and passions have led me to different paths. For the very first time I have felt a passion for what I am learning and what I will eventually be doing-----Full Stack Web Development.
      </p>

      <p style="font-size: 15px;">I am cognizant that I still have a long journey ahead and quite a bit to learn, it is indeed the in-depth challenges of Web Development that has sparked my interest and I am looking forward to mastering what I have learned thus far as well as taking on new challenges in whole. Taking an active approach to learn something new has always been a part of who I am, but this time it really is different-- I am pursuing a passion rather than an interest and that has made me feel complete within. 
      </p>

      <p style="font-size: 15px;">If I had to describe one thing that I cherish in life, it is the time that we are given. In essence all we have is time along with choices---may as well be wise with them both!</p>
